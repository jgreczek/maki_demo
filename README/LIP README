The LED drivers and the code to control the arduino board are all written in the "arduino code" folder.

Running the code:
The arduino code is already installed in the board. Hence we only need to connect to the board serially and publish messages.
use the command "rosrun rosserial_python serial_node.py /dev/ttyXXXX", where XXXX is the port number to which the arduino is connected to.
This port number can be obtained from serial monitor or by just opening arduino software and seeing the right-bottom side of the window.
In this particular PC, left USB port starts from /dev/ttyACM0 and right side starts from /dev/ttyUSB0.
By running this command we have established a serial connection between board and ROS. Now we can publish any msg on "led_array" topic of typ Int8.

Simplest way to publish is to run the command "rostopic pub led_array std_msgs/Int8 XX" where XX is the two digit integer. 
Everytime we run this with different values, different face will be loaded on maki.

Faces and color:
The first digit in the two digits of msg defines the face and second digit defines the color.
color:
1-red
2-blue
3-green
4-yellow
5-purple
6-white
7-blank/dark

mouth:
1-D
2-O
3-smile 
4-Smile curvy
5-Big smile

Giving any other number will lead to preset default values.

Adding more faces and colors:
We can add faces and colors in the arduino code. Open arduino IDE and go to "arduino code/maki-led-mouth-next/arduino/maki_led_mouth/maki_led_mouth.ino".
Here we can add colors and faces in the given space accordingly.

Integrating with maki demo:
Once the rosserial serial_node is running and connection is established we just need to publish integers on the topic "led_array". 
So in the maki_test node we can add lines to continuously publish integers of corresponding mouths and colors onto this topic.
