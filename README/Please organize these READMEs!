This is a note from Jill to please get these READMEs organized, delete old ones that don't apply anymore (or if you are worried, move them to a folder in Documents labeled "Old READMEs" or something), and combine the remaining into a cohesive document.

Also: continue to remove junk files and extra copies of packages and files from this machine.  Is the pyvona on the desktop the pyvona that needs to be used in this code?  If so, move it to somewhere in the sandbox and NOT on the desktop.  Do not store files on the desktop unless they are instructions for running something.
